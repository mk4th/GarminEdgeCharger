# Garmin Edge Charger
Open source charging option for the edge devices via the electrical contacts on its back

Garmin Edge products can be used for long distance rides such as bikepacking or touring as long as they are being charged frequently. Yet, the only option to charge them in a cable free method is the very expensive PowerPack, which can provide a mediocre runtime of up to 24 hours of ride.
Here we’ll mainly explore the charging interface, while the “backend” of the power source is to your choice.
